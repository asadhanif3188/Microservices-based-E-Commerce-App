# Microservices based E-Commerce App - Deployed on Kubernetes

In this demo application, we are going to deploy a **microservices** based **E-Commerce** web application with **11** microservices on Kubernetes.

Application credit to [Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo).

## Description 
**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application. Online Boutique consists of a 11-tier microservices application. The application is a web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.

**Google uses this application to demonstrate use of technologies like Kubernetes/GKE, Istio, Stackdriver, gRPC and OpenCensus**. This application works on any Kubernetes cluster, as well as Google Kubernetes Engine. Itâ€™s easy to deploy with little to no configuration.

## Architecture
Online Boutique is composed of 11 microservices written in different languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

## Microservices Detail
As a DevOps engineer, we need following information from the developer, to deploy the Microservices:
- Which microservices need to be deployed?
- Which microservice is talking to which microservice? 
- How are they communicating? 
  - Directly using API calls
  - Message Broker
  - Service Mesh 
- Which database are they using? 3rd Party Services
- On which port does each microservice run? 
- Which service is accessible form outside the K8s cluter?

In this microservices demo, Redis as a Message Broker or in-memory database is being used.
