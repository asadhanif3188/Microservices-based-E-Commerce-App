# Microservices based E-Commerce App - Deployed on Kubernetes

In this demo application, we are going to deploy a **microservices** based **E-Commerce** web application with **11** microservices on Kubernetes.

Application credit to [Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo).

## Description 
**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application. Online Boutique consists of a 11-tier microservices application. The application is a web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.

**Google uses this application to demonstrate use of technologies like Kubernetes/GKE, Istio, Stackdriver, gRPC and OpenCensus**. This application works on any Kubernetes cluster, as well as Google Kubernetes Engine. Itâ€™s easy to deploy with little to no configuration.

## Architecture
Online Boutique is composed of 11 microservices written in different languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

## Microservices Detail
As a DevOps engineer, we need following information from the developer, to deploy the Microservices:
- Which microservices need to be deployed?
- Which microservice is talking to which microservice? 
- How are they communicating? 
  - Directly using API calls
  - Message Broker
  - Service Mesh 
- Which database are they using? 3rd Party Services
- On which port does each microservice run? 
- Which service is accessible form outside the K8s cluter?

**Note:** In this microservices demo, Redis as a Message Broker or in-memory database is being used. 

### Brief Description of Microservices

|Microservice |Language |Description             |
|----------|-------|----------------------------| 
| frontend     | Go | Exposes an HTTP server to serve the website. Does not require signup/login and generates session IDs for all users automatically.|
| cartservice  | C# | Stores the items in the user's shopping cart in Redis and retrieves it. |
| productcatalogservice  | Go | Provides the list of products from a JSON file and ability to search products and get individual products. |
| currencyservice  | Nodejs | Converts one money amount to another currency. Uses real values fetched from European Central Bank. It's the highest QPS service. |
| paymentservice  | Nodejs | Charges the given credit card info (mock) with the given amount and returns a transaction ID. |
| shippingservice  | Go | Gives shipping cost estimates based on the shopping cart. Ships items to the given address (mock). |
| emailservice  | Python | Sends users an order confirmation email (mock). |
| checkoutservice  | Go | Retrieves user cart, prepares order and orchestrates the payment, shipping and the email notification. |
| recommendationservice  | Python | Recommends other products based on what's given in the cart. |
| adservice  | Java | Provides text ads based on given context words. |
| loadgenerator  | Python/Locust | Continuously sends requests imitating realistic user shopping flows to the frontend. |

### Microservices Ports and Env. Variables

## Create Deployment and Service Configurations
In this section we are going to create **Deployment** and **Service** configuration files for all microservices. 

For simplicity we'll create a single manifest file, i.e. `kubernetes-manifests/simple-config.yaml`, for all microservices, so that we can deploy them in a single go.

## Deploying Microservices into K8s Cluster
It is time to deploy all microservices into the K8s cluster, i.e. Minikube. 

Before deployment let us create a separate namespace, so that all microservices work under this namespace. 

### Create Namespace
Run following command to create namespace. 

`kubectl create namespace shop-microservices`

### Deploy Microservices
Run following command to deploy all microservices. 

`kubectl apply -f simple-config.yaml -n shop-microservices`
